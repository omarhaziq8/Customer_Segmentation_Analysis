# Customer_Segmentation_Analysis
**Description** : Trained with over 32,000 dataset of customer in a marketing campaign

**Algorithm Model** : Deep Learning method->> BatchNormalization,Dropout,DenseLayer,NeruralNetwork

**Preprocessing step** : Train_test_split, LABEL_ENCODER, ONE HOT ENCODER

**Objectives** :  
1) To produce outcome with accuracy 70%% range of prediction by model trained
                  
2) To predict customer to subscribe product

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1) Data Loading
2) Data Inspection
3) Data Cleaning
4) Features Selection
5) Pre-Processing
6) Model Development -->> DeepLearning
7) Model Evaluation


**Model evaluation** :

`Classification_report`
`accuracy_score`
`Confusion_Matrix`
`Model_train_test_split`
`pickle`
`EDA`

**Data Features** :

1) id	
2) customer_age	
3) job_type	
4) marital	
5) education
6) default	
7) balance	
8) housing_loan
9) personal_loan	
10) communication_type
11) day_of_month
12) month	
13) last_contact_duration
14) num_contacts_in_campaign
15) days_since_prev_campaign_contact
16) num_contacts_prev_campaign
17) prev_campaign_outcome
18) term_deposit_subscribed

**Discussion** :

 ðŸŸ The dataset 32000 customer dataset and 17 features with drop ID column which ID is unnecessary for data training
 
 ðŸŸ Category and continous features are captured and plotted graph to see correlation
 
 ðŸŸ Therefore, from the info of datasets and graph, it shows that there are lot of NaNs value/missing value
 
 ðŸŸ In data cleaning, and to compute the NaNs value, the unnessary column,column that has alot of NaN value has to be drop else less accuracy
 
 ðŸŸ The model is successfully develop by using batchnormalization,denselayer NN,dropout
 
 ðŸŸ from the graph evaluation,loss and acc illustrate a bit underfitting graph but still acceptable for training since it has 90% accuracy score
 
 ðŸŸ confusion_matrix,classification_report and f1-score is computed at the end of coding script and shows 90% acc
 
 ðŸŸ The model is ready for deployment testing
